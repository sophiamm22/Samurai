## Value Samurai

**Value Samurai** is an ASP.net Web API *Automated Betting Value Calculator*.

The software uses **Football** and **Tennis** predictions from [Decision Technology](http://www.dectech.co.uk/football.html) and [Tennis Betting 365](http://www.tennisbetting365.com/) respectively, to calculate the best value bets from a variety of bookmakers *and* betting exchanges.

For more information and past performance please visit the [Value Samurai](http://value-samurai.net) website.

* ..and do so asynchronously.  One thing sorely lacking from the current implementation.

### Thanks

The following have already unwittedly contributed, and deserve praise...

* Some names..
